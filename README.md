## Hello There! General Kenobi, I am Yuri Poledna

I am a Reseach Fellow, with experience in Hardware in the Loop, Vehicle in the loop, deep experience in Python, C++, Bare metal installation, Java, MATLAB, Simulink, git environments. I do sensor models in carla, and i have a lot of things that are NDA'ed saddly.

I have also created the [ROADVIEW Project github organization](https://github.com/roadview-project/). And implemented unit testing in some repositories.

Born in the python interpreters and gcc compiler, I have always been interesting new topics, thats why i like a lot about rockets, planes, and NUCLEAR FUSION.
I expect for this century to exceed our collective wildest dreams.

Ask me about about rockets, planes, nuclear fusion, or cars, or anything.
